# wordleclone

*Introduction*

A basic worldle clone that draws a word list from a file. Wordle is a word game in which users are instructed to guess a five letter word, and are told if each letter in their guess is in the correct spot, the wrong spot, or not in the word at all. 

*To use*

Simply installing will have everything you need in place. In order to get the word list imported change the location of the words.txt directory to match yours by changing the username or any other location difference.
